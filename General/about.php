	<center><h1>Our Mission</h1><br><br>
	<p>Khawaja Group of companies completes 25 years of incorporation in Pakistan. We laid the groundwork and drew up the blueprints for a truly exceptional National Transportation Service Provider with the name of Faisal Movers in early 90s.  Today, we are one of the largest privately held logistic services Provider in the Country.  Tomorrow and beyond, we are still innovating ways to be even more reliable, competitive, and responsive to the needs of our customers.

	As founder and Chairman of the group, I always believed that “people are the heart of any organization.”

	This people-oriented philosophy fosters a company-wide pride in our shared work of being one of the largest and most successful Public Transport and logistical enterprise nationwide.  It also animates our forward thinking, technology-driven mindset.  Because we have acquired the resources, experience, skills and initiatives necessary to be proactive problem-solvers for our customers, we have transformed our client relationships into true partnerships. Based on that premise, our mission is to hire and retain top-quality employees, Flag4-Congratulations! provide them with the finest tools and technologies available, and then challenge them to meet and exceed the highest standards of performance. I have no hesitation in praising and applauding the Directors, Management  and employees of the group who have put their best of efforts and skills to make the group to a strong and socially responsible business enterprise.

	Still I feel that we have to go a long way to accomplish our long term objectives and for that I have strong faith in ALLAH Almighty, Management and the employees and their skills, that we will able to achieve all of our goals. (INSHA ALLAH)
